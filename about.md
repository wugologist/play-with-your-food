# About the Name

Food is fun. It's science, art, culture, and history. You engage with it three times per day, not counting the midnight fridge raids. It's too big a part of your life to stick with what's familiar. Don't just learn new recipes, learn to improvise. Cross cultures, mix techniques, and swap ingredients. Star in your own personal cooking competition, and scare the judges with the ice cream maker. Mix things up. Have some fun with it. Play with your food.

# About the Recipes

You'll mostly find two types of recipes here. The first type is what I think of as "components". These are your basic preparations that might be part of a larger dish: a loaf of bread, a chunk of meat, pasta sauce. Think of them as the building blocks of your culinary creations. If I'm posting an especially elaborate recipe, some preliminary preparation might be posted as its own component if it could work on its own or as the base for other creations. The second type is the fun stuff. These might combine multiple components into something new, or they might be twist on a classic. These might also include some ideas (which may or may not be tested) for additional variations if you want to try your hand at making a recipe your own.

# About the Author

Michael Wong grew up watching a lot of Alton Brown, so he's pretty much always been like this. One time he made cookie dough so good it made someone cry. You can [contact him](/contact) if you like.

# About the Kitchen

All this is coming to you live from the greater Boston area, in a kitchen with an underpowered oven, stand mixer that makes distressing noises under high load, and unfortunate lack of ventilation, although besides that it's actually quite nice.

# About the Site

This site is maintained as a Github repo. If that means anything to you and you're curious how it works (the recipes are stored as YAML files, which is pretty neat), check it out [here](https://github.com/wugologist/play-with-your-food). I made the search bar and tag system before there was a single proper recipe posted, which tells you something about my ability to prioritize.
