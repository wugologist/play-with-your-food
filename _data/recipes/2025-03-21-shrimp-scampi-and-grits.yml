steps:
  - Drain shrimp of any liquid and blot dry with a paper towel. Peel shrimp, reserving shells in a small saucepan and shrimp in a medium bowl. Add salt, baking soda, and cornstarch to bowl, stir to coat shrimp, and set aside for about 30 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, add olive oil to pan of shrimp shells and set over medium-high heat. Cook shells briefly until pink, then add stock. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20 minutes, adding mushroom stems, parsley stems, scallion roots, and any other trimmings as you prepare those ingredients.
  - Meanwhile, bring another 3 cups of stock to a boil in a separate large saucepan or Dutch oven. Add grits and whisk to combine. Bring to a gentle simmer and cook, whisking frequently, for 20 minutes. Mixture will resemble a thick batter.
  - Meanwhile, add olive oil and pancetta to a large saute pan and set over medium heat. Cook until pancetta is brown and fat is rendered, about 5 minutes. Remove pancetta with a slotted spoon and reserve. Drain all but 1 tablespoon fat, reserving excess.
  - Raise heat to high and, when fat is just starting to smoke, add shrimp. Cook for 1 minute on each side, until pink all over but interior remains slightly translucent. Remove shrimp with slotted spoon and reserve.
  - Reduce heat to medium-high, add reserved pancetta fat, heat until shimmering, then add mushrooms. Season lightly with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until browned. Remove mushrooms with slotted spoon and reserve. Remove pan from heat, but do not wash.
  - Once shrimp shell stock has been simmering for 20 minutes, strain it through a fine mesh strainer into a heatproof measuring cup or bowl. Add 2 cups (475 ml) of stock to grits, 1 cup at a time, whisking thoroughly after each addition to break up any clumps. You should have about 3/4 cup (175 ml) stock remaining. Continue simmering grits for 40 minutes more (1 hour total), whisking frequently.
  - When grits have about 15 minutes left, return saute pan to medium-high heat with olive oil. When shimmering, add garlic, scallion whites, and red pepper flakes and cook until aromatic but not browned, about 30-60 seconds. Add vermouth and scrape the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon to deglaze. Cook until raw alcohol smell dissipates and liquid reduces slightly, about 3 minutes.
  - Add remaining shrimp stock, bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes, until liquid is reduced slightly. Add reserved pancetta, mushrooms, and shrimp and heat for 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice and add salt to taste.
  - Once grits are creamy and thick, add cheese and stir until melted. Taste and add salt if needed. Keep over very low heat until ready to serve.
  - To finish, bring shrimp mixture to a boil. Add butter 1 tablespoon at a time, stirring vigorously to emulsify each piece completely into the sauce before adding next piece. When last piece is emulsified, remove from heat and stir in lemon zest, parsley, and scallion greens. Scoop grits into bowls, top with shrimp and sauce, and serve immediately.

notes:
  - Do not use instant grits or polenta here.
  - To make pescatarian, omit pancetta. Use additional olive oil as needed to saute shrimp and mushrooms.
  - Leftover grits will solidify as they cool. You can reheat them by slicing the leftovers into slabs and browning them in a nonstick skillet with a little olive oil or butter.
