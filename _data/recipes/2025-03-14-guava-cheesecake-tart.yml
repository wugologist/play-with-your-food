    step: 4
    prep: par-baked

equipment: 
  - small saucepan
  - stand mixer, hand mixer, or whisk
  - 9- or 9 1/2-inch removable-bottom tart pan
  - sheet tray

steps:
  - Heat oven to 325°F/160°C. Cut guava paste into a few pieces and add to a small saucepan along with water. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring and mashing with a flexible spatula, until paste melts into a smooth liquid.
  - Transfer guava paste to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, if using, or a medium bowl if not. Beat on medium speed (or by hand) until any remaining bits of paste are broken up. Add cream cheese a few tablespoons at a time, beating until smooth between each addition. Add salt, lemon juice and zest, vanilla, and rum, if using, and beat until smooth.
  - Add eggs one at a time, beating until combined between each addition. If using a stand mixer, scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure mixture is thoroughly combined.
  - Pour mixture into tart crust, set on sheet tray to catch drips, and bake for 25-30 minutes, until filling is still slightly jiggly in the center. Let cool for 1 hour before serving.

notes:
  - If you don't want to make the crust, you can bake the filling in a store-bought graham cracker crust or in individual ramekins without a crust.
