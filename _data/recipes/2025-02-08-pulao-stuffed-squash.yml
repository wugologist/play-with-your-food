equipment: 
  - sheet tray
  - pastry brush
  - fine mesh strainer

steps:
  - Rinse rice in a fine mesh strainer until water is mostly clear. Cover with water in a small bowl and leave to soak for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.
  - Combine spices and sugar in a small bowl and set aside.
  - Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add ground lamb, season with salt, and cook until browned.
  - Add carrots, onion, and garlic and saute until onion is translucent.
  - Add spice mixture and saute until aromatic, about 30 seconds.
  - Stir in crushed tomatoes, raisins, and pistachios and bring to simmer. Taste and adjust for seasoning, then remove from heat. Drain rice in a fine mesh strainer and add to meat mixture.
  - Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in honey and a large pinch of salt and set aside to cool slightly.
  - For each squash, cut a thin slice off the bottom so it can sit upright. Cut about 1 inch off the top, reserving lid. Scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy flesh with a spoon and sprinkle insides liberally with kosher salt.
  - Fill each squash with rice mixture, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top of each to allow room for the rice to expand as it cooks. Arrange on a parchment- or foil-lined baking sheet.
  - Cover squash with their lids and brush all over outside with honey butter.
  - Bake for two hours, or until squash is tender and rice is cooked.
  - Meanwhile, combine yogurt, garlic, mint, and salt in a small bowl and refrigerate until needed.
  - When squash is cooked, optionally transfer to cutting board and slice into wedges before serving with yogurt sauce.
