yield: about 35 1-inch pieces

ingredients:
  - name: smooth natural peanut butter
    quantity: 1 lb (450g)
    step: 2
  - name: Diamond Crystal kosher salt
    step: 2
    quantity: 1 tsp (3g)
    note: only if peanut butter is unsalted
  - name: granulated sugar
    quantity: 11.5 oz (325 g, 1.5 c plus 2 Tbsp)
    step: 3
  - name: water
    quantity: 1/2 c (120 ml)
    step: 3
    note: approximately
  - name: bittersweet chocolate chips
    quantity: 12 oz (340 g)
    step: 6
    note: or roughly chopped chocolate

equipment: 
  - 9"x5" loaf pan
  - parchment paper
  - sheet tray
  - medium heatproof bowl
  - small saucepan
  - heatproof spatula
  - digital or candy thermometer

steps:
  - Line a 9"x5" loaf pan with enough parchment paper to form a sling, with the paper going up the sides of the pan enough to form handles to grab later. Also line a sheet tray with parchment.
  - Add peanut butter to a medium heatproof bowl and stir in salt, if using. Set aside.
  - In a small saucepan, combine granulated sugar and water. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Cook without stirring until mixture reaches 245°F/118°C.
  - Immediately pour sugar mixture into the peanut butter and stir to combine with a heatproof spatula. Continue stirring and scraping the sides of the bowl until mixture thickens and pulls aside from the sides of the bowl in a dough-like mass.
  - Working quickly, scrape the mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Fold the overhanging parchment over the top of the mixture and firmly press into the corners of the pan with the bottom of a measuring cup. Let cool for at least 30 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, wash and completely dry bowl and spatula, making sure no water remains on either. Bring an inch of water to a bare simmer in the saucepan and set bowl over it to form a double boiler. Add chocolate and melt, stirring occasionally.
  - Remove cooled halva from the pan using the parchment sling and cut into 1-inch cubes. Using two forks, dip each cube into melted chocolate, then remove to the lined sheet tray. Refrigerate briefly to set chocolate before serving.

notes:
  - Processed peanut butter will not work here. Make sure you use a natural peanut butter made only with peanuts and possibly salt.
  - Do not use salt containing anti-caking additives, as this will keep the halva from attaining the proper texture.
