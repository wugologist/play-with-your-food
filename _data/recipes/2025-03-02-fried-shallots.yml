ingredients:
  - name: shallots
    step: 2
  - name: neutral oil
    step: 2
  - name: kosher salt
    step: 3

equipment: 
  - sheet tray
  - fine mesh strainer
  - medium heatproof bowl
  - mandoline slicer
  - small saucepan

steps:
  - Line a sheet tray with two layers of paper towels. Set a fine mesh strainer over a heatproof bowl.
  - Using a mandoline, slice shallots into approximately 2mm thick rings. Place in a small saucepan, nearly cover with oil, and place over high heat. 
  - Cook, stirring frequently with chopsticks, until bubbling begins to subside and shallots turn a light golden color. Immediately drain in prepared strainer, transfer to prepared sheet tray, spread evenly, and sprinkle with salt. After a moment, remove top layer of paper towels, and allow to cool to room temperature on the second layer before using.

notes:
  - Fried shallots will continue to darken after cooking, so drain them while they're still a shade lighter than desired.
  - Shallot oil can be used in any recipe that calls for neutral oil and would benefit from the addition of a light shallot flavor.
