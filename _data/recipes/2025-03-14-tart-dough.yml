  - name: egg
    quantity: 1 large
    step: 2
    prep: straight from the fridge
  - name: cold water
    quantity: 1 tsp
    step: 2

equipment: 
  - box grater
  - rolling pin
  - 9- or 9 1/2 inch removable-bottom tart pan
  - sheet tray

steps:
  - In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt. Grate butter directly into flour mixture, then stir with a flexible spatula to break up butter and mix with flour. Using your fingertips, rub butter into flour until mostly incorporated and sandy, with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.
  - Form a well at the bottom of the bowl and add egg and water. Lightly beat with spatula, then stir together with flour mixture, at first with spatula but then by hand, just until a cohesive dough forms. If dry flour remains at the bottom of the bowl, add a few drops of water while mixing.
  - Turn out dough onto a square of parchment paper, press into a disk, and cover with a second sheet of parchment. Roll into an 11-inch circle, frequently turning and flipping the dough packet so it rolls out evenly and peeling parchment paper off periodically to ensure dough doesn't stick. If dough becomes sticky or refuses to roll out further, transfer to a sheet tray, still between parchment, and chill in the refrigerator for 15 minutes before continuing.
  - Carefully transfer crust to tart pan, avoiding stretching the dough when pressing into the corners. If there are any cracks or gaps, trim a piece of dough from elsewhere to patch. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 1 hour before baking. Now is a good time to get your filling ready.
  - While dough is chilling, preheat oven to 375°F/190°C. Remove dough from refrigerator and prick bottom all over with a fork. Trim the edges of the dough to be even with the lip of the pan. Cover dough again with foil, this time pressing into corners.
  - Transfer tart pan onto a sheet pan and bake for 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 4 minutes for a par-baked crust, or an additional 7 to 10 minutes for a fully-baked one. Transfer to a rack and let cool.
