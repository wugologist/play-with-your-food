equipment: 
  - saute pan
  - sheet pan
  - pastry brush

steps:
  - Melt butter in a saute pan over medium heat until foaming. Add leek, season with salt and pepper, and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
  - Combine cooked leeks and cream cheese in a small bowl and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper and set aside.
  - Season the salmon filets on both sides with salt and pepper and set aside.
  - Unroll one sheet of puff pastry. Spread half the cream cheese mixture in a rectangle in the center of the sheet about the size of one salmon filet. Place a salmon filet on top of the cream cheese mixture. Fold sides of pastry over salmon to enclose, trimming excess if needed. If dough is too short in one direction, you can use a piece of trimmed dough to fill in the gap. Place seam side down on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Repeat with remaining sheet of pastry.
  - Freeze salmon packets for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 425°F/220°C.
  - While salmon chills, prepare the sauce. In a small bowl, combine the capers, parsley, shallot, lemon juice and zest, and olive oil. Taste and season with salt if needed. Refrigerate until ready to serve.
  - After 30 minutes, remove salmon from freezer. Lightly score a crosshatch pattern into the dough with a sharp knife. Beat egg with water and brush over pastry. Sprinkle generously with everything bagel seasoning and bake for 30 minutes, until pastry is golden brown. Let rest for 5 minutes before serving. 

notes:
  - If pastry isn't sufficiently browned after baking, you can move the tray to the upper third of the oven and broil very briefly to color the top. Check every 30 seconds if you do this, as the pastry can burn after just a minute or two.
