equipment:
  - large saute pan
  - two sheet trays or large baking dishes
  - pastry brush
  - paring knife

steps:
  - Place rice in a small bowl and rinse several times, until water is mostly clear. Cover rice with cool water and leave to soak while your prepare the rest of the filling. Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C. Line sheet trays with aluminum foil or parchment paper.
  - Combine spices and sugar in a small bowl and set aside.
  - Heat oil in a large saute pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add ground lamb, season with salt, and cook until browned.
  - Remove lamb from pan with a slotted spoon, keeping any fat in the pan. Add additional oil if pan is dry, then add onion and saute until golden brown. If bottom of pan threatens to scorch, add a splash of water and scrape up darkened bits.
  - Add garlic and cook until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Add spice mixture and saute another 30 seconds.
  - Stir in canned tomatoes, stock or water, carrots, raisins, and pistachios, bring to a simmer, and cook for five minutes. Taste and adjust for seasoning, then remove from heat. Pour off water from rice and add to meat mixture.
  - While filling simmers, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir in honey and salt and set aside to cool slightly.
  - For each squash, cut a thin slice off the bottom so it can sit upright. Cut about 1 inch off the top, reserving lid, and scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy flesh with a spoon. Arrange on two parchment- or foil-lined baking sheets. Using a pastry brush, liberally brush each squash inside and out with honey butter, including the lids. Stir any remaining honey butter into filling.
  - Fill each squash with rice mixture, leaving about 1 inch of space at the top of each to allow room for the rice to expand as it cooks.  Bake for 1 1/2 to 2 hours or until squash is very tender and rice is cooked. Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
  - While squash bakes, combine yogurt, garlic, and salt in a small bowl and refrigerate until needed.
  - To serve, place each squash on a plate and remove lid. Using a paring knife, slice each squash into six or eight wedges. Nudge the wedges apart and use the tip of the knife or a fork to fluff rice. Serve with yogurt sauce.

notes:
  - If you don't want to make all 8 squash at once, make only half the honey butter and yogurt mixtures and freeze half the filling for later. Let thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using with another half batch of honey butter and yogurt sauce.
