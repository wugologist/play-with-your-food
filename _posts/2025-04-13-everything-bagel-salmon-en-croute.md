Anything *en croute*--wrapped in puff pastry--is fancy. Beef Wellingtons, wheels of brie, old socks, whatever you've got, if you wrap it in flaky pastry and bake until golden brown, people will be impressed. Salmon en croute is a classic, a salmon filet wrapped in pastry, often with some sort of vegetable and sauce to make the fish pop tart of your dreams.[ยน](#notes) We're giving this a twist inspired by my favorite fish-in-bread preparation: the everything bagel with lox and cream cheese. Just like they make in the delis in Paris. Maybe.

# One With Everything

A bagel and lox has a few components to consider for adaptation. The lox itself we're replacing with a fresh salmon filet, as using a slab of smoked salmon would be both quite salty and prone to overcooking. We're evoking the everything bagel by topping our puff pastry with premade everything bagel seasoning, though you could of course replace this with the bagel toppings of your choice, such as sesame seeds, poppy seeds, coarse salt, or anything else you've seen on a bagel (though if you try to go cinnamon raisin, I cannot be held responsible for the outcome).

A good schmear of cream cheese goes in our pastry packet to melt into a sort of instant sauce. To evoke scallion cream cheese--my choice whenever available--while providing some degree of vegetable matter, we saute some leeks and mix them into the cream cheese. Mixing in some raw scallions would not be a bad move if you're after a stronger allium kick.

Of course, any good bagel and lox needs a few additional fixings. I usually get mine with capers and raw onions, which here we're including as a sort of gremolata. Just mince up some capers and shallots (vaguely French, keeping with the theme), add lemon zest and juice, stir in some parsley and olive oil, and you've got a sharp, fresh sauce to balance the richness of the salmon and cream cheese. 

# Wrap It Up

Assembling your bagel pastry might seem daunting, but like the rest of this dish, it's much easier than it seems. Lay out each of your sheets of puff pastry and figure out where the salmon is going to go so that you can completely envelop it in the pastry. You may need to roll out the dough if your filet is especially large, or, if there's a thinner end, you can trim off the thin piece and place it on top of the rest of the filet to make a more compact, even shape. Remove the salmon and spread half the cream cheese mixture on each sheet of pastry in the same shape and position as the filets, then replace the fish on top.

Wrap the pastry over the fish, press the seams to seal, and flip the whole packet over so the seams are on the bottom. You could bake this right away, but to maximize the puff and flakiness of the dough it's important that it be well-chilled before it goes into the oven. Freezing the packets for half an hour before cooking yields a better end result; just consider it an opportunity to clean up and maybe get a side dish ready.

Once chilled, lightly score just the top surface of the dough with a sharp knife if you want a decorative flourish, then brush the whole thing in an egg wash and sprinkle generously with everything bagel seasoning before baking. In half an hour the salmon will be cooked through and the pastry will be golden brown and flaky, and the hardest part of the whole process is letting it rest five minutes before serving.

## Play Around

If you're into whitefish salad, you could swap the salmon with something like trout and add raw dill and celery to the cream cheese instead of leeks.

If you're inclined to get lettuce and tomato in your bagel, you can make a simple salad and convert the sauce as a quick dressing with some extra olive oil and lemon juice.

## Notes
1. Assuming you dream of fish pop tarts. If you didn't before, you just might now.
