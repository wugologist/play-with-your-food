There are no quantities given for this recipe, because you can never make enough fried shallots. If I made a claim like "makes 1 cup", you would leave angry comments about how you only got half a cup at the end.[ยน](#notes) This isn't because the recipe is flawed; it's because when you make fried shallots right, you'll eat them like chips before they can make their way into the final recipe.

The bones of this recipe come from [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/thai-style-fried-shallots), but it's simple enough to summarize in one sentence: slice a bunch of shallots into rings about 2 millimeters thick, put in a pot with not quite enough oil to cover, and cook over high heat until lightly golden. The hardest part, if there is one, is moving quickly at the finish. The shallots will darken quickly at the end, even after draining, so you'll want to pull them out before they're your desired color.

In the spirit of not burning things, you'll also want to be ready with a strainer set in a bowl to drain the oil from your shallots, plus a sheet pan with two layer of paper towels. The first layer will quickly become sodden with oil, so we simply pour the drained and salted shallots onto the second layer after a moment so they aren't sitting in oil. Don't throw out the oil, though--it's been infused with a light shallot flavor and can be used as an ingredient in its own right, in vinaigrettes or as a noodle topping, or just as a substitute for normal oil in future dishes.

Don't be disappointed if you try a freshly fried shallot and it's limp--they only really crisp up once they're cool. Once cooled, you can pour the shallots into a sealable container and keep at room temperature until ready to use. Just don't be surprised if you don't have enough when you reach for them.
