# Contact

You can send any questions, corrections, invitations, salutations, donations, accusations, or missed connections to [michael@playwithyour.food](mailto:michael@playwithyour.food). Note that the reply will come from a different email address, at least until I decide it's worth it to pay for proper email hosting here.

Currently this site isn't on any social media. This might change eventually, but don't hold your breath.
